Freedom to express yourself, freedom to create, freedom to learn and share knowledge, freedom to imagine, freedom to think... to be. Websites used to be owned by actual human beings, and were virtual homes of someone's mind and soul.

Some music can even lead us to a place where a fundamental spiritual shift of consciousness can happen. At best, it can conjure a sacred space.
